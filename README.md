# Repository for final project, STA 199 Spring 20 Section 002

**Modify this README!**

Reminder: Proposal due April 6, 11:59pm US Eastern Time
Reminder: Full Project due April 30, 2:00pm US Eastern Time

You must turn in relevant components to Gradescope in order to receive credit.

In addition to your Gradescope submissions, we will be checking your GitHub repository. 
This repository should be contributed to equally by all team members and should include

- RMarkdown file (formatted to clearly present all of your code and results) that will 
output the proposal and write-up in one document
- Meaningful README file on the GitHub repository (modify this file!)
- Dataset(s) (in csv or RData format, in a `/data` folder)
- Presentation (if using Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides, export to PDF and put in repo, in a `/presentation` folder)

**There is no late work accepted on this project.** 
Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps.

With the outbreak of the global coronavirus pandemic, we understand that not all 
students may be in the same timezone. With this understanding, however, we will be 
strict regarding late work with respect to the US Eastern Time Zone, and all components 
must be submitted to Gradescope by the deadline in order to receive credit.

**If you do not turn in your final project on time, you will not pass the course.**
